Before you begin
================

Before you begin you need some preparations.

Software
--------

m_Librarian is written in Python and requires Python 2.7. So install
Python 2.7 first. Install required modules: SQLObject and m_lib.


Library archives
----------------

The program works with local library archives so download some. In
addition to the very libraries you need to get INPX indices for them â€”
m_Librarian cannot index libraries yet.


Database
--------

The program needs a database. It can work with any database supported by
SQLObject. Preferred ones are: MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite. If you plan
to use an SQL server you must create a database yourself. For SQLite,
the database file will be created by the program, so it's the simplest
way of using m_Librarian.
